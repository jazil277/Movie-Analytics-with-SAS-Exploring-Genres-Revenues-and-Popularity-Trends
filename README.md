## Movie-Analytics-with-SAS-Exploring-Genres-Revenues-and-Popularity-Trends

# Project Description:

This project focuses on analyzing a movie dataset using SAS to uncover insights about genres, movie ratings, revenue, and popularity trends over time. It merges multiple datasets, performs detailed statistical analyses, and visualizes key findings. The project highlights how different genres perform in terms of revenue, which movies had high or low budgets, and how factors like budget and production relate to popularity. Additionally, the project explores patterns in movie ratings and runtime.

# Objectives of the Assignment:
- Import and merge datasets to create a comprehensive movie dataset.
- Analyze the average movie ratings over time and identify trends.
- Determine detailed summary statistics for movie revenues and find the highest-grossing film.
- Investigate the popularity and distribution of various genres.
- Calculate the correlation between budget and popularity.
- Classify movies into "Good," "Moderate," or "Bad" based on their average rating.
- Identify movies with high or low budgets and those longer than 2 hours.

# Key Findings:
- Movie Ratings: Average movie ratings have fluctuated over the years, with movies before the 1930s generally receiving higher ratings.
- Revenue: The movie with the highest revenue generated $x (specific value to be filled in after running the code).
- Popular Genres: Drama is the most popular genre, making up 11.62% of the dataset, followed by Comedy and Action.
- Budget and Popularity: A positive correlation exists between production budget and movie popularity.
- Top Movies: The analysis classified movies based on ratings and budget, identifying top-performing films in various categories.

# Technologies Used:
- SAS: For data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization.
- ODS Graphics: To generate charts and plots for visual insights.
- PROC MEANS, PROC FREQ, PROC UNIVARIATE: To compute statistics and explore data distributions.
- PROC SGPLOT and PROC SGRENDER: For generating scatter plots, pie charts, and trend lines.

# How to Run the Code:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install SAS and ensure it is properly configured.
3. Import the datasets into your SAS environment.
4. Navigate to the appropriate directory containing the SAS scripts.
5. Run the scripts in the order provided using SAS.
6. Review the output files (PDFs and visualizations) for detailed results.
